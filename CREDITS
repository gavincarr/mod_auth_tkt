Peter Karman <peter@peknet.com>, Ivo De Decker <ivo.dedecker@ugent.be>
(the debian maintainer), and Deitmar Berg <dietmar.berg@thalesgroup.com>
all supplied patches to update mod_auth_tkt to work with apache 2.4.
The 2.4 updates are based on their work.

Bearnard Hibbins <bearnard@gmail.com> provided a cookie parsing fix for
when badly behaved proxy/cache servers strip whitespace from headers.

Scott Shambarger <devel@shambarger.net> added the TKTAuthGuestEmpty
directive, allowing guest access to set REMOTE_USER to "", which allows
some http-auth systems to fallback to another authenticator. He also
updated TKTAuthQuerySeparator to be a string (allowing better inheritance,
and fixed some minor compile/build issues.

David McNett <nugget@flightaware.com> contributed example code for a
back-end login written in Tcl (for use with Apache Rivet). Available in
contrib/tcl.

Christian Folini <christian.folini@time-machine.ch> and an anonymous Swiss
bank sponsored the changes to include SHA256/SHA512 support, and to
integrate and test Michael Peters' TKTAuthSecretOld functionality. Version
2.0.99b1.

Michael Peters <mpeters@plusthree.com> provided a patch to support a
TKTAuthSecretOld fallback secret, to facilitate refreshing secrets without
losing existing sessions. Version 2.0.99b1.

Brian Kuschak <bkuschak@yahoo.com> provided patches to convert relative
redirect URLs to absolute ones using current schema/hostinfo settings.

Sascha Hanssen <hanssen@meso.net> provided a ticket generator for Ruby on
Rails, included in the contrib directory. Version 2.0.0rc3.

Peter Karman <peter@peknet.com>, Jose Luis Martinez <jlmartinez@capside.com>,
and Ton Voon <ton.voon@altinity.com> provided patches to Apache::AuthTkt to
allow it to parse and validate existing tickets. Version 2.0.0rc3.

Charlie Brady <charlie_brady@mitel.com> provided patches to honour the
X-Forwarded-Host header in cookie domains and back references, if set (for use
behind a proxy). Version 2.0.0rc2.

Joost Cassee <joost@cassee.net> provide a patch to port mod_auth_tkt to Apache
2.2 and provided help testing and debugging under that environment. Version
2.0.0rc2.

Philip Garrett <Philip.Garrett@manheim.com> provided patches to implement the
TKTAuthGuestFallback functionlity, allowing validated users to fallback to
guests on ticket timeout. Version 2.0.0rc2.

Michael Peters <mpeters@plusthree.com> provided a patch to add an additional
TKTAuthTimeoutPostURL directive to allow timeouts on POSTs to be handled
differently (since redirects back aren't sensible).  Suggested by Perrin
Hawkins. Version 2.0.0rc1.

Jay Kline <slushpupie@gmail.com> provided a patch to add an apachever argument
to configure (allowing mod_auth_tkt to be built with only an apache development
environment available), and provided patches to build a debian package. Version
2.0.0b8.

Larry Lansing <llansing@fuzzynerd.com> provided a patch to separate out secure
cookie functionality from TKTAuthRequireSSL flag to new TKTAuthCookieSecure
flag. Version 2.0.0b7.

Viljo Viitanen <Viljo.Viitanen@helsinki.fi> provided patches to fix some URI
and HTML escaping problems in the sample cgi scripts.  Version 2.0.0b7.

Christian Ramseyer <rc@networkz.ch> pointed out a couple of build problems on
Solaris and contributed fixes. Version 2.0.0b7.

Ian Bicking <ianb@imagescape.com> provided patches for the excellent
TKTAuthGuestLogin functionality, for additional debug output with the
DEBUG_VERBOSE flag, and contributed a more complete python AuthTicket class. He
also identified a bug with non-base64 quoted ticket values not being parsed
correctly. Versions 2.0.0b5 and 2.0.0b6.

Viljo Viitanen <Viljo.Viitanen@helsinki.fi> pointed out that using wildcard
cookie domains by default allowed hostile servers on a shared domain to steal
and reuse tickets. So the default is now to default to the server name only -
wildcard domains can easily be used, but must be done explicitly. Version
2.0.0b4.

Ian Bicking <ianb@imagescape.com> patched configure to work with a less capable
getopt on FreeBSD, and provided patches to correct some non-ISO-C89 c-isms that
were causing problems for his gcc.  Version 2.0.0b3.

Christian Klinger <cklinger@novareto.de> contributed python code to generate
tickets, included in contrib/auth_ticket.pyc.  Version 2.0.0b2.

Luc Germain and Marc-Andre Gaudreau at Universite de Sherbrooke contributed
code to generate tickets from php, included in contrib/auth_ticket.inc.php.
Version 2.0.0b2.

Andreas Leimbacher <leimbachera@post.ch> submitted patches to fix some bogus
logging calls, to add secure cookie support to TktUtil.pm, and contributed a
configure script to improve the build process.  Version 2.0.0b2.

Nick Cleaton <njc@netcraft.com> identified a significant vulnerability in the
calculation of the ticket md5 checksum, potentially allowing an attacker to
change or manipulate their username, tokens, and/or user data, and suggested a
change to the md5 checksum calculation to fix the problem.  Version 2.0.0a1.

Joe Laffey <joe@laffeycomputer.com> did a thorough security review of the code
and found buffer overflow vulnerabilities in both mod_auth_tkt itself and
tkt_cookie, and submitted patches to fix them.  Version 1.3.11.

Matti Lattu <matti.lattu@helsinki.fi> provided patches to implement the
TKTAuthRequireSSL directive, to require ssl and use secure ticket cookies.
Version 1.3.11.

Jason Burns <jason@dhdmedia.com> contributed code allowing tickets to be passed
via the url instead of via cookie, and suggested the initial framework about
how allowing multi-domain configurations might be able to work under
mod_auth_tkt.  Version 1.3.9.

Christian Folini <folinic@post.ch> submitted some great patches enabling
multiple TKTAuthToken directives allowing alternative tokens; adding the
strsep() function for use on Solaris; adding the scheme (http/https etc) when
generating back URLs; and suggested having user tokens made available to other
handlers (which lead to the REMOTE_USER_TOKENS env variable).  Version 1.3.9.
