Charlie Brady <charlie_brady@mitel.com> provided patches to honour
the X-Forwarded-Host header in cookie domains and back references, 
if set (for use behind a proxy). Version 2.0.0rc2.

Joost Cassee <joost@cassee.net> provide a patch to port mod_auth_tkt 
to Apache 2.2 and provided help testing and debugging under that
environment. Version 2.0.0rc2.

Philip Garrett <Philip.Garrett@manheim.com> provided patches to
implement the TKTAuthGuestFallback functionlity, allowing validated
users to fallback to guests on ticket timeout. Version 2.0.0rc2.

Michael Peters <mpeters@plusthree.com> provided a patch to add an
additional TKTAuthTimeoutPostURL directive to allow timeouts on 
POSTs to be handled differently (since redirects back aren't sensible).
Suggested by Perrin Hawkins. Version 2.0.0rc1.

Jay Kline <slushpupie@gmail.com> provided a patch to add an apachever
argument to configure (allowing mod_auth_tkt to be built with only
an apache development environment available), and provided patches
to build a debian package. Version 2.0.0b8.

Larry Lansing <llansing@fuzzynerd.com> provided a patch to separate
out secure cookie functionality from TKTAuthRequireSSL flag to new
TKTAuthCookieSecure flag. Version 2.0.0b7.

Viljo Viitanen <Viljo.Viitanen@helsinki.fi> provided patches to fix
some URI and HTML escaping problems in the sample cgi scripts.
Version 2.0.0b7.

Christian Ramseyer <rc@networkz.ch> pointed out a couple of build 
problems on Solaris and contributed fixes. Version 2.0.0b7.

Ian Bicking <ianb@imagescape.com> provided patches for the excellent
TKTAuthGuestLogin functionality, for additional debug output with the 
DEBUG_VERBOSE flag, and contributed a more complete python AuthTicket 
class. He also identified a bug with non-base64 quoted ticket values
not being parsed correctly. Versions 2.0.0b5 and 2.0.0b6.

Viljo Viitanen <Viljo.Viitanen@helsinki.fi> pointed out that using 
wildcard cookie domains by default allowed hostile servers on a shared 
domain to steal and reuse tickets. So the default is now to default to
the server name only - wildcard domains can easily be used, but must be
done explicitly. Version 2.0.0b4.

Ian Bicking <ianb@imagescape.com> patched configure to work with a less
capable getopt on FreeBSD, and provided patches to correct some 
non-ISO-C89 c-isms that were causing problems for his gcc.
Version 2.0.0b3.

Christian Klinger <cklinger@novareto.de> contributed python code to
generate tickets, included in contrib/auth_ticket.pyc.
Version 2.0.0b2.

Luc Germain and Marc-Andre Gaudreau at Universite de Sherbrooke 
contributed code to generate tickets from php, included in 
contrib/auth_ticket.inc.php. Version 2.0.0b2.

Andreas Leimbacher <leimbachera@post.ch> submitted patches to fix some 
bogus logging calls, to add secure cookie support to TktUtil.pm, and
contributed a configure script to improve the build process.
Version 2.0.0b2.

Nick Cleaton <njc@netcraft.com> identified a significant vulnerability in
the calculation of the ticket md5 checksum, potentially allowing an 
attacker to change or manipulate their username, tokens, and/or user data, 
and suggested a change to the md5 checksum calculation to fix the problem.
Version 2.0.0a1.

Joe Laffey <joe@laffeycomputer.com> did a thorough security review of the
code and found buffer overflow vulnerabilities in both mod_auth_tkt 
itself and tkt_cookie, and submitted patches to fix them.
Version 1.3.11.

Matti Lattu <matti.lattu@helsinki.fi> provided patches to implement the
TKTAuthRequireSSL directive, to require ssl and use secure ticket cookies. 
Version 1.3.11.

Jason Burns <jason@dhdmedia.com> contributed code allowing tickets to be 
passed via the url instead of via cookie, and suggested the initial 
framework about how allowing multi-domain configurations might be able to
work under mod_auth_tkt. 
Version 1.3.9.

Christian Folini <folinic@post.ch> submitted some great patches enabling
multiple TKTAuthToken directives allowing alternative tokens; adding the
strsep() function for use on Solaris; adding the scheme (http/https etc) 
when generating back URLs; and suggested having user tokens made available 
to other handlers (which lead to the REMOTE_USER_TOKENS env variable).
Version 1.3.9.
