- add a writeable test on manpage directory, for local installs by unpriv user
- look into Tom Seeley's 'require user joe' problem, esp. wrt return codes
  back to Apache
- consider adding a directory-level TKTAuthDirSecret, to allow pure .htaccess 
  configuration (as suggested by Reg de Crombrugghe)

- implement TKTAuthCookieExpires support for Apache 1.3
- fix date problems in t/10_cookie_expiry
- rename TKTAuthDomain to TKTAuthCookieDomain (retaining other for backward
  compatibility for now)
- would be nice to separately store ip_addr in ticket, so we can identify
  ip address mismatches and log a warning (e.g. hammer ssl problem)
- backref formation seems to be using CanonicalName, when ideally it should
  use whatever name was actually used ...
- add warning to cross-domain docs about the possibility of authenticator
  leakage via referer links
- consider whether we should include alternate hash functions e.g. sha1
- new features:
  o token and payload (or whole cookie) encryption
  o review proxy handling of X-Forwarded-IP and X-Forwarded-For (hostname)
  o network-specific timeouts?
  o allow secret key to be settable from .htaccess (e.g. ISP contexts)
  o warn on whitespace in token lists
  o consider whether we should change TKTAuthIgnoreIP to TKTAuthIPNetmask, with 
    the default being 255.255.255.255, and the equivalent of 'TKTAuthIgnoreIP on'
    being 0.0.0.0 (or just 0). This would allow you to weaken the IP requirement
    gradually without simply turning it off e.g. allow multiple IPs as long as 
    they're from the same class C
