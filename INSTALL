Installation
============

Requires: an apache with DSO support, either 1.3.x, 2.0.x, or 2.2.x.

  $ ./configure --apxs=/path/to/apxs
  $ make
  $ make test         # (can take a while due to timeout tests)
  # make install 

(Or install from the RPMs for RHEL/CentOS 4/5).



Basic Configuration
-------------------

1. Copy conf/02_auth_tkt.conf to an apache conf include directory like
   /etc/httpd/conf.d (or include explicitly from your httpd.conf),
   and edit, UPDATING THE SHARED SECRET BEFORE YOU USE. 


2. If you want to use the standard mod_auth_tkt CGI scripts, copy the
   conf/auth_tkt_cgi.conf config to your apache conf include directory
   as well (e.g. /etc/httpd/conf.d), and edit. You must uncomment one
   of the three /var/www/auth sections there, depending on whether you
   want to use mod_perl 2, mod_perl 1, or vanilla CGI. The mod_perl 2 
   version is recommended if you have it.


3. Set up your login pages. If you want to use the supplied CGI scripts,
   copy the files in the 'cgi' directory somewhere useful e.g.

     cp -rp cgi /var/www/auth

   CGI scripts are available in /usr/share/doc/mod_auth_tkt-<version>/cgi
   when using the RPM, to copy somewhere manually, or you can install the 
   mod_auth_tkt-cgi package:

     # Installs to /var/www/auth by default
     rpm -Uvh mod_auth_tkt-cgi        
     # Install somewhere else
     rpm -Uvh --prefix=/var/www/cgi-bin mod_auth_tkt-cgi

   The scripts requires perl and the CGI perl module. You will need to 
   edit the /var/www/auth/AuthTktConfig.pm config file to define a 
   username/password authentication function against your repository of 
   choice (the example one uses a standard apache htpasswd file). You
   can also tweak a few other customisable settings there.

   You should also confirm you've uncommented one of the cgi sections in
   the 02_auth_tkt.conf config you installed in (1).


3. If you're using mod_auth_tkt on the open internet (rather than on
   a private network) you should probably set 'TKTAuthIgnoreIP on', at
   least initially. This avoids a whole class of weird problems that
   aren't necessarily obvious (ISP transparent proxies, for instance). 
   If you have a very constrained set of users you may be able turn it 
   off later after you've got everything working.



Advanced Configuration Options
------------------------------

1. Multi-domain logins: although cookies are domain-specific,
   mod_auth_tkt now supports multi-domain logins and logouts by
   passing the authentication ticket via the URL to a new domain.
   To setup multi-domain logins, one of your domains should be 
   designated the primary domain, and your login and logout scripts 
   should be configured as normal for that domain - test your primary
   domain is working as desired. Then, if you are using the supplied 
   CGI scripts, you should use 'autologin' mode for the secondary 
   domains, which basically just looks for an existing ticket (on the
   primary domain) and passes it via a URL parameter back to your
   secondary domain. Autologin mode is configured by creating a 
   symbolic link to 'login.cgi' called 'autologin.cgi' and using the 
   autologin.cgi version in your TKTAuthLoginURL. Something like the
   following should then work for all your domains:

      AuthType Basic
      require valid-user
      TKTAuthCookieName auth_tkt
      TKTAuthLoginURL https://www.mydomain.com/auth/autologin.cgi
      TKTAuthTimeoutMin 60

   (Note that no TKTAuthDomain is set, because this fragment is being 
    used for multiple domains. TKTAuthDomain defaults to the parent 
    domain when undefined - .mydomain.com in this case - which is 
    usually what you want.)
