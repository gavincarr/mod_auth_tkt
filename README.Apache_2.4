Upgrading to Apache 2.4
-----------------------

Starting with version 2.2.0, mod_auth_tkt supports Apache 2.4
taking advantage of the new "provider" model for authentication/
authorization.

In particular, mod_auth_tkt now acts as an authorization provider
and allows you to use the much more versatile 'Require' directive
instead of TKTAuthToken:

  Require tkt-group token1 token2 ...

Note that the "entity-name" needs to be 'tkt-group' and not
just 'group' to direct the check to mod_auth_tkt (this also
applies for similar modules, e.g. mod_auth_dbm -> dbm-group
and is *not* documented in the Apache 2.4 doc).

The remainder of the directive is a list of one or more tokens
of which at least one must be present in the ticket for a user
to be granted access to the resource.

Using the standard 'Require' directive together with the new
<RequireAny/All> sections allows to build arbitrarily complex
access control expressions.

Example config:

   TKTAuthSecret       "my shared secret"
   <Location "/">
      TKTAuthLoginURL  https://sso.some.where/login
      TKTAuthDomain    .some.where
      #
      Order            allow,deny
      Allow            from all
      Require          all granted
   </Location>

   <Location "/jackpot">
      Require         tkt-group  gamblers taxpayers
   </Location>

Note that there are no AuthBasic* directives anywhere.
On authorization failure, the session is immediately
redirected to the error page.
